# Find Your Hat

This Node.js\terminal-based application generates a maze with a hat, holes, and ensures there is always a path to the hat. The objective is to move through the maze, without falling into any holes, until you find your hat. If you fall into a hole or off the maze, you lose.

The initial maze will always be the same; however, if you choose to replay without ending the game, subsequent mazes will be random. 

For simplicity, mazes are limited to a minimum 3x3 or maximum 10x10 matrix, and holes are exposed. The goal of this Codecademy Challenge Project is to work on maze generating algorithms.
